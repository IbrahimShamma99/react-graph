# React Graph mock server

This mock server is built by [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). All the mocked data are put in file `db.json`. 


## Start mock server

Please clone or download this project to your local, and use `npm` or `yarn` to install the dependences and start server:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Or

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Then you can access `http://localhost:3031/nodes/` to see if the server is started correctly.

## APIs

You can refer the document of [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to see the full APIs. 

Also here are some APIs you might want to use:

### Get nodes list

```
GET http://localhost:3031/nodes
```

The response of this request would be the JSON of all nodes list.

### Get links list

```
GET http://localhost:3031/agents/{id}
```

The response of this request would be the JSON of the agent which match the id.

### Change one node

```

{
    "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    "body": {MODIFIED NODE}
}
```

The `body` parameter is a JSON of the modified node, here is an example:

```
"body": {
      "name": “REACT NEO4J“,
      "id": 0
    }
```

{
    “headers”: {
        “Content-Type”: “application/json”
    },

}
```

```
“body”: {
      “value”: 1,
      “source”: 0,
      “target”: 9,
